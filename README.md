# FizzBuzz
A possible solution to the FizzBuzz challenge, can be improved A LOT

Ideas:
- Use arrays to allow for more multipliers/strings
- Use only two Ifs for outputs and just build the output as you go along
- Use the frequency of the main thread as another method of counting
- Add Start/Stop buttons
- Let the user decide all the constants
- etc...
